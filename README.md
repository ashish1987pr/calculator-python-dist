    instructions provided in the Usage section to perform arithmetic operations using the
    Standard calculator.


## Usage:
	### Instructions for Performing Various Calculation Operations:
    
		1. Performing Arithmetic Operations: To perform any arithmetic operation, enter the
		   first number followed by the desired arithmetic operator button (+, -, *, /), then
	 	   enter the second value, then press the equals (=) button.

		2. Performing Series of Arithmetic Operations: To perform a series of arithmetic
	 	   operations (e.g., 895 + 94.5 - 45 / 2 * 3 + 10%), simply enter the operations in the
	  	   order specified in the expression.

		3. Calculating Percentage: To calculate a percentage, enter the number followed by the
  		   % button (e.g., 1250%). This will calculate 1% of the entered value.

		4. Calculating Specific Percentage: To calculate a specified percentage of any value,
  		   enter the number followed by the * (asterisk) button and then the desired percentage
	  	   value followed by the % button (e.g., 1250 * 10% = 125).

		5. Adding Calculated Percentage to Original Value: To add the calculated percentage
		   value to the original value, perform the operation like this: `1250 + 10% = 1375`.
	  	   Similar operations are allowed with other operators along with the percentage symbol
	   	   (e.g., `1250 / 10%`, `1250 - 10%`).

		6. Handling Division by Zero: In case of division by zero, a "Division by Zero Error"
		   will be raised in the display and operator buttons (+, -, *, /, %) will be disabled.
	  	   To reset the calculator, press any enabled key like C, CE, Back, or 0-9 keys.

 		7. Negating a Value: To negate the value, simply enter the value followed by the +/-
    	   button.
		
  		8. Resetting the Calculator: To reset the calculator, press the C (Clear) button.
	
 		9. Clearing the Current Entry: To clear the current entry, press the CE (Clear Entry)
   		   button.
		
  		10.Removing the Last Digit of the Current Value: To remove the last digit of the current
		   value, simply press the Back key.
